This project is a REST API built using the Spring Boot framework. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a resource (e.g., "Employee" or "Product"). 
The API is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate with other services or clients, like a web or mobile application.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: For creating the RESTful API.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions.
H2/MySQL: As the database.
Postman: For API testing.
